j2g — JSON to Go Struct Converter

Usage:
  j2g < input.json > output.go

Description:
  j2g reads JSON data from standard input and writes the corresponding Go struct
  definition to standard output. It’s useful for quickly generating Go types
  based on example JSON responses or payloads.

Example:
